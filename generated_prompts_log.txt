prompt 3: "Marketing creative product advertisement image. MINIMAL & PROFESSIONAL style - EXPERIMENTAL & DYNAMIC VARIATION.
PRODUCT: A robust, two-stage gas-powered TORO Power Max 826 OAE snow blower. The main body is glossy Toro Red, with a matte black frame, handles, and wheels. The engine and control panel are charcoal gray and black with silver accents. Brand text "TORO POWER MAX" and "FLEX-FORCE" is clearly visible.
COMPOSITION STYLE: Dynamic Asymmetry composition. The snow blower is placed off-center to the right, tilted at a slight 10-degree angle to create a sense of action. Layered depth is created by placing text and graphic elements both in front of and behind the product.
BACKGROUND: A deep, moody navy blue (#101C2B) studio background with a single, dramatic spotlight shining down on the product, casting a long, sharp shadow to the left.
DESIGN ELEMENTS: Abstract, glowing light trails in white and gold streak across the background, mimicking the motion of blowing snow or festive lights. A large, faint, geometric snowflake crystal graphic is subtly layered behind the snow blower.
COLOR PALETTE: A dramatic palette of deep navy (#101C2B), Toro Red (#CC0000), and sharp white, with a striking warm gold (#FFD700) accent for the CTA and light trails.
TEXT ELEMENTS - EXACT PLACEMENT & STYLE:
BRAND NAME: Brand name text reading "TORO" at the top left, in a clean sans-serif font, partially layered behind the handle of the snow blower to create depth, in white.
HEADLINE: Headline text reading "UNWRAP POWER" is stacked vertically down the left side of the image, using a condensed, impact sans-serif font, large prominent size, in white. A cutout effect is applied to the text, revealing the glowing light trails in the background through the letters.
Call-to-action reading "SHOP NOW" as an unconventional style: bold white text followed by a simple, elegant gold arrow icon, positioned at the bottom right. No button shape.
PROMOTIONAL BADGE: A creative, gold, starburst-shaped sticker graphic displaying "25% OFF" in bold navy text, positioned so it slightly overlaps the front corner of the snow blower's auger housing.
SEASONAL ELEMENTS: The Christmas theme is interpreted abstractly, with glowing light trails suggesting festive lights and motion, and large, stylized snowflake crystal graphics in the background creating a modern, wintery feel.
LIGHTING & MOOD: Dramatic, high-contrast spotlighting creating long architectural shadows, which results in an energetic, attention-grabbing, and innovative mood.
