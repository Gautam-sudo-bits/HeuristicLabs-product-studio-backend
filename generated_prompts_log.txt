prompt 3: "Marketing creative product advertisement image. MINIMAL & PROFESSIONAL style - EXPERIMENTAL & DYNAMIC VARIATION.
PRODUCT: A compact, utilitarian faucet made of highly reflective, polished chrome-plated metal. The faucet features a single, quarter-turn lever handle, a short, downward-curving spout with a stepped hose connector nozzle, and a threaded male inlet pipe. The design is simple, functional, and modern.
COMPOSITION STYLE: Dynamic Asymmetry. The faucet is positioned off-center to the right, creating dramatic negative space on the left. The product is shot from a slightly low angle to give it a heroic feel.
BACKGROUND: A dark, textured concrete or slate surface, providing a gritty and durable feel that contrasts with the faucet's polished chrome finish.
DESIGN ELEMENTS: A single, dramatic, long architectural shadow is cast from the faucet across the background to the left. The composition is stark and minimalist, relying on the interplay between the product, shadow, and text.
COLOR PALETTE: Primary: Dark Slate Gray (#333333). Accent: Bright White (#FFFFFF). Supporting: Medium Gray.
TEXT ELEMENTS - EXACT PLACEMENT & STYLE:
BRAND NAME: Brand name text reading "AQUAFLOW" at the bottom right, tucked near the corner, using a simple sans-serif, small size, in a medium gray color.
HEADLINE: Headline text reading "RELIABLE. EVERY DROP." positioned on the left side, stacked vertically with "RELIABLE." above "EVERY DROP.", using a condensed, impactful sans-serif font, large prominent size, in bright white. The text fills the negative space and balances the faucet.
Call-to-action reading "SHOP NOW" as an unconventional style: bold white text with a simple white arrow icon (→) next to it, placed at the bottom center. No button background.
PROMOTIONAL BADGE: A loud, sticker-style graphic with a slightly distressed edge, displaying "NEW", positioned to slightly overlap the threaded inlet pipe of the faucet, in a high-contrast white with black text.
