This is a 4K, 16:9 cinematic shot. Feature: Establish the hero composition of the stacked pair of navy blue canvas sneakers. Camera: 50mm lens, starting on a medium shot showing the full pair. A slow, elegant camera arc begins from front-left to front-right with a subtle push-in. Pose Anchor: The pair of navy blue canvas sneakers with white soles and silver eyelets are static, stacked exactly as in the reference image. Lighting: Soft, diffused key light from upper right, gentle fill from the left, with a cool-toned rim light to separate the blue canvas from the background. Environment: The shoes rest on a pristine matte white pedestal against an abstract background of large, soft-focus, light blue and white geometric forms. Continuity: Start from initial state: medium wide shot, left-of-center framing. End state: Camera is mid-arc, now framing the shoes centrally, slightly closer. Motion is continuous.",

      "timestamp2_prompt": "Use provided reference images as canonical ground truth; replicate exact product identity, pose/configuration, color, materials, finish; product remains static; never in operation. This is a 4K, 16:9 cinematic shot. Feature: Highlight the form of the toe box and the clean lacing system. Camera: 50mm lens. The camera continues its smooth arc-and-push-in motion, transitioning into a tighter medium-close shot. Framing narrows to focus on the front half of the top shoe, from the white rubber toe cap to the third eyelet. Shallow depth of field begins to soften the background shapes. Lighting: Consistent soft key and rim lighting, creating a gentle highlight along the curve of the toe. Environment: The pristine matte white pedestal and abstract blue/white background remain consistent. Continuity: Start from end state: camera is mid-arc, framing shoes centrally. Continue the arc and push-in. End state: Camera has settled at a 3/4 front-right angle, framing the top shoe's toe, laces, and brand tag, ready for a detail shot. The camera motion is at a near stop."

      "timestamp1_prompt": "Use provided reference images as canonical ground truth; replicate exact product identity, pose/configuration, color, materials, finish; product remains static; never in operation. This is a 4K, 16:9 cinematic shot. Feature: Showcase the 'differente' brand tag and the texture of the navy blue canvas. Camera: 85mm macro lens. The camera performs a slow, precise lateral glide from right to left along the side of the top shoe. Focus is critically sharp on the white fabric 'differente' tag, with the foreground laces and background heel falling into soft focus. Lighting: A soft kicker light catches the texture of the canvas weave. Overall lighting remains consistent with Segment 1. Environment: The shoe remains on the matte white surface, with the abstract background now a soft, out-of-focus bokeh. Continuity: Start from end state: 3/4 front-right angle, framing the top shoe's toe, laces, and brand tag. The new motion is a pure lateral slide leftwards. End state: The 'differente' tag is perfectly centered in the macro frame. Camera is still sliding left.",

This is a 4K, 16:9 cinematic shot. Feature: Emphasize the clean stitching on the heel counter and the texture of the white rubber sole. Camera: 85mm macro lens. Continue the slow lateral glide to the left. The focus smoothly racks from the brand tag to the precise stitching detail on the shoe's heel section. The clean line where the canvas meets the ribbed white sole is prominent in the lower third of the frame. Lighting: Rim light defines the curve of the heel. Specular highlights are controlled and clean. Environment: The matte white surface and bokeh background remain consistent. Continuity: Start from end state: 'differente' tag centered in macro frame, camera sliding left. Continue the slide. End state: The frame is filled with the macro detail of the heel's canvas texture, stitching, and the top edge of the white sole. Camera motion comes to a complete stop."
